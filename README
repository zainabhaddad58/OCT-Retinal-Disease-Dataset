## Retinal-OCT-Clinical-Dataset

The Retinal-OCT-Clinical-Dataset is a collection of clinically acquired retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images intended to support research in automated retinal disease classification and medical imaging AI.

The dataset includes multiple retinal conditions:
- Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
- Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)
- Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment (RRD)
- Healthy/Normal cases

### Data Access

Due to patient confidentiality, institutional regulations, and ethical approval constraints, the dataset is distributed under controlled access conditions.

Researchers interested in accessing the dataset for non-commercial scientific purposes may request access via the official Figshare repository:

Access requests are evaluated to ensure compliance with ethical and data protection requirements.

### Intended Use

This dataset is suitable for:
- Training and evaluation of deep learning models for retinal disease detection
- Multi-class classification benchmarking
- Research on medical image analysis and clinical AI
