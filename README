The Retinal-OCT-Clinical-Dataset is a collection of clinically acquired retinal OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images, designed to serve as a benchmark for deep learning models in retinal disease classification.
The dataset includes images from multiple retinal pathologies:
      AMD (Age-related Macular Degeneration)
      DME (Diabetic Macular Edema)
      RRD (Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment)
      Healthy/Normal cases
⚠️ Access: To ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and patient privacy, the dataset is available upon reasonable request under controlled access conditions.
This dataset is suitable for:
  Training and evaluating deep learning models for retinal disease detection.
  Benchmarking classification performance across multiple retinal pathologies.
